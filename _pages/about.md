Greetings! My name is Guanming Liu, a master student from **Tongji University**, majoring in computer science and technology. My research interests primarily focus on **Computer Vision**, particularly in the topic of Generative Models, Image Representation (Implicit Neural Representation) and Multi-modal Learning.

News
======

* The first-authored paper "Extending Implicit Neural Representations for Text-to-Image Generation" is **accepted** by ICASSP 2024. ðŸŽ‰
* I am exploring an image evaluation metric based on multi-modal contrastive models like CLIP and signal frequency analysis to calculate the topology discrepancies.
* The paper "VL-MTT: Lightweight Multitask Transfer for Visual-Language Pre-trained Models" is under submission.
* Ramping up for my next TOEFL bout! ðŸš€ðŸ“šðŸ’ª
